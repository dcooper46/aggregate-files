# aggregate-files
combine files in a directory, deduplicate, and aggregate necessary columns

Simple script to combine files such as panels, surveys, etc. where records
should be deduplicated and there may be some column that should be aggregated
or averaged; e.g. a weight.

This is not general, just a simple example. 

TODO: 
 * generalize to accept variable features to aggregate or average
 * dont assume format
